<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**Assignment B3: OPTION B: DEVLOP A NEW SHINY APP** The goal of
assignment-b3-Marcella-Cross is to design a new shiny app with at least
three features:

- Feature 1: Tabular Plots: Histogram, Scatter plot, Table
- Feature 2: Slider Bar: for interaction with the histogram
- Feature 3: Check Boxes: for interaction with the histogram
- Feature 4: Image: for aesthetics
- Feature 5: Main Title

**New additions with B4:**

- Feature 6: Select menu for chicken ages 1 Day to 10 Weeks to display
  an image of that age
- General improvements to aesthetic and display of features to add
  additional spacing and lines to clarify different sections.

This app allows users to better understand how diet affects chick
development for the first 21 days of life. Different diets show
different weights over the 21 days.

The app I have designed uses data from the datasets package built into
R. The data is called ChickWeight and can be viewed here:
<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/ChickWeight.html>.

The function of the app is to create an interactive tool that lets you
view an interactive histogram, scatter plot, and a table of the data.
